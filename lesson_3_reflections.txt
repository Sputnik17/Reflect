When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  to backup your work or make it public

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
	Perhaps you are busy adding a new feature on you local repository, hence by staying up to date with your 
	remote repository, one will clear the work done locally.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	I would fork a github repository if i would want to have my own copy of the files that i will 
	change myself. I would clone the github repo when i would like to get a local copy of the repo, or
	if i would like to create a second copy of the local repo on my pc. Finally, the branch command can 
	be used when one wants to perhaps add a new feature while leaving the master branch still intact for 
	other people to work on
